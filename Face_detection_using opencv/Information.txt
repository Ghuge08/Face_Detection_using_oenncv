FACE_DETECTION USING IMAGE


Step 1: Collect tons if faces.

Step 2: Make them black and white because our haar cascade algorithm works on 
        gray scale images only.
       
Step 3 : Train the algorithm to detect faces.

we use cascade classifier to detect the face.
image is matrix of bunch of pixels with numbers and bits

detectMultiscale detect object of different seizes no matter what is the
scale of the object i.e small or big
Object are detected and returned as list of rectangles co-ordinates.

Haar Cascade algorithm
haar is a chain of event.
This algorithm uses haar feature to process the image
There are two types of haar features
 1. Edge feature
 2. Line feature
Black and white portion allow us to approximate relationship of pixels

Image is made of the various pixels. White portion of the image  have more 
pixel and black portion has less. So white pixel add it all pixels also the 
black pixel. After addding we subtract them. If their difference is in
between specific value them we can say that image is detected. 

By spreading features all over the image and cascading down all different 
layers to locate matches, we chain all 5 features and their combination 
provides you entire template of image.
